Scripts used to downgrade Magento Commerce to Magento Open Source

Recently did a migration of a Magento Commerce site to Magento Open Source. Obviously there were some issues, mostly in the sheer amount of database changes required.

The main script here is based on the work found at https://github.com/opengento/magento2-downgrade-ee-ce
I fixed some issues with the script as is discovered by painfully having to fix them one by one. The scripts are also combined into one script because you need all of them.

This particular migration was Magento Commerce 2.3.2-p1 to Magento Open Source 2.3.2-p1. Other versions of Magento may have different requirements.
